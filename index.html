            <p>Although the tower and its fortress were constructed many centuries earlier, the community of Torrent was
                formally created by individuals of European origin in 1248, during the Reconquista. According to
                archaeological study, the area was inhabited during the Bronze Age.</p>
            <p>Eastern Spain's Valencia Comunidad Autónoma includes the city of Torrent, sometimes known as Torrente, in
                its east-central province. Southwest of Valencia City it is located. The Torre de Malta (Maltese Tower),
                a fortress with Moorish roots located in the heart of the city, is where the name Torrent originated.
                James I of Aragon gave the city to the Knights of St. John (becoming the Knights of Malta) in 1248, and
                they held onto it until 1807. A regional agricultural market exists. In Torrent, products including
                shoes, chocolate, and canned foods are made. 64,338 as of 2008 estimates.</p>
